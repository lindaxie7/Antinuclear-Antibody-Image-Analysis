# Image-Classification
Auto-immune disorder detection from antinuclear antibody images


### Project Overview:
Creating machine learning models that predicts ANA specificity for double stranded DNA (dsDNA), use machine learning to discover new staining patterns.



###  Data Source:
Hospital internal data 

Images labeled as two groups: dsDNA positive, dsDNA negative

Images Total = 7500, Positive = 1500, Negative = 6000;
